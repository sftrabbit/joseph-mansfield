# Joseph Mansfield

This is the source for my personal website. The website is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Prerequisites

Articles, blog posts, and media are kept in submodules which need to be initialized and cloned:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You'll also need to [install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install), then install Ruby 2.4.1 and bundler:

```bash
rvm pkg install openssl
rvm install "ruby-2.4.1" --with-openssl-dir=/usr/share/rvm/usr
rvm gemset create JosephMansfield
rvm 2.4.1@JosephMansfield 
gem install bundler -v 2.2.3
```

## Build

First install dependencies and then build:

```bash
bundle install
jekyll build
```

## Articles

Article sources are kept separately at [sftrabbit/JosephMansfieldArticles](https://github.com/sftrabbit/JosephMansfieldArticles). To add them to the build, simply do:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sftrabbit/JosephMansfieldArticles.git articles/_posts
```
